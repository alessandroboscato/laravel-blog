Hello Mr Anderson,

Would you like the Red Pill or the Blue Pill?

You're task is to create a "Blog" like website with "Posts" and "Comments"
Post has a 1 to many Relationship with Comments

Your Steps:
1. Create new github branch called `feature/YOUR-NAME`
2. Create the necessary database tables. NOTE: add extra columns like `title` or `description` for trinity points.
3. Create a Eloquent Model for both `Post` and `Comment`. Remember: 1 to Many Relationship
4. Create a CRUD (create, read, update, delete) for both `Post` and `Comment`. NOTE: routes, controllers and blades are needed.
5. Git commit and push your code.
6. Create a pull request on github.

Well done Mr Anderson. 

Welcome to the Matrix.
